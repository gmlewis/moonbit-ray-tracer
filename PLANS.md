### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
Focus on Scene Description System and basic CLI to make the tool actually usable by others.

### Phase 2: Performance (Weeks 5-8)
Implement parallel rendering and basic spatial acceleration to handle realistic scene complexity.

### Phase 3: Modern Rendering (Weeks 9-16)
Add PBR materials and advanced lighting to produce professional-quality output.

### Phase 4: Polish & Ecosystem (Weeks 17-24)
Complete the tool with documentation, examples, and advanced features.

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Render complex scenes (1000+ objects) in reasonable time
- [ ] Support standard 3D file formats (OBJ, GLTF)
- [ ] Produce photorealistic images comparable to commercial tools
- [ ] Provide intuitive user interface for non-programmers
- [ ] Maintain code quality and comprehensive test coverage

## Notes

- Each checkbox represents a substantial development task (1-5 days of work)
- Some tasks may be parallelizable or can be worked on incrementally
- Priority levels can be adjusted based on user feedback and development progress
- Consider creating separate GitHub issues for major features
- Regular benchmarking and testing should accompany each implementation phase
